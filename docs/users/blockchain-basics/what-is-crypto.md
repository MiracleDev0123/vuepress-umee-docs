# What is Crypto?

Crypto is an entirely new asset class that is completely digital. There are many different types of crypto-assets that all share a few common traits:

* Crypto-assets are native to the internet.
* Crypto-assets use [<mark style="color:blue;">blockchain technology</mark>](what-is-a-blockchain.md) to record transactions in a decentralized and trustless manner.
* Crypto users have total control over their assets and do not need to rely on any intermediaries like banks to transact with one another. It's like exchanging physical cash without the hassle of... exchanging physical cash.

While many popular centralized payment services like bank transfers, Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal allow users to exchange funds, they are not permissionless, censorship resistant, or convenient for all users.&#x20;

### Permissionless

**With centralized services** users must be granted permission in order to use them. Sign ups require a "KYC" process in which users typically provide a government issued ID and personal information in order to be approved. If the services want to, or are ordered to, they have the ability to block transactions or freeze accounts at any time.

**With crypto** users are able to transact with one another freely. No centralized intermediary can prevent the transfer of funds or freeze a user's account.

### >Censorship Resistant

**With centralized services** many people may are unable access basic financial tools due to things like their physical location or background.

**With crypto**, anyone with an internet connection can access a decentralized network and transact as they'd like.

### Convenient

**With centralized services** transactions are often slow and expensive for users.&#x20;

**With crypto,** funds can be transferred instantly with near zero transaction costs for users.

If [<mark style="color:blue;">blockchain technology</mark>](what-is-a-blockchain.md) is thought of as an accounting system, crypto can be thought of as the units of account used in the system. Crypto allows anyone with an internet connection to experience the benefits provided by [<mark style="color:blue;">blockchain technology</mark>](what-is-a-blockchain.md).

## What Are the Types of Cryptos?

There are countless types of crypto-assets. The most common types include [<mark style="color:blue;">native cryptocurrencies</mark>](what-is-crypto.md#native-cryptocurrencies), [<mark style="color:blue;">stablecoins</mark>](what-is-crypto.md#what-are-stablecoins), [<mark style="color:blue;">utility tokens</mark>](what-is-crypto.md#utility-tokens), and [<mark style="color:blue;">governance tokens</mark>](what-is-crypto.md#governance-tokens).

### Native Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are the most well-known type of crypto-asset. Cryptocurrencies are simply digital units of account intended to be used as traditional currencies are used: as a medium of transfer and/or a store of value.&#x20;

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a form of crypto-asset that are intended to allow users to enjoy the benefits of crypto and web3 without having to deal with the volatility commonly associated with other cryptos. Stablecoins achieve their price stability by being pegged to or backed by a commodity or fiat currency, or by using algorithmic economics to regulate supply and demand. Many popular stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, meaning that in theory they can always be redeemed by a user for $1 or $1 worth of another asset.

> _**Stablecoins can be classified based on their stability mechanism. The most common types of stablecoins are fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed, and algorithmic.**_

#### Fiat-Backed Stablecoins

Fiat-backed stablecoins aim to hold their pegs by maintaining reserves in fiat currencies. These stablecoins are commonly pegged to the US dollar due to its strength relative to other currencies.

**Advantages**

Fiat-backed stablecoins are a popular choice among DeFi users because they have faith that they can redeem one fiat-backed stablecoin for one physical unit of the currency it represents at any time.



**Disadvantages**

Centralized entities are needed to issue fiat-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves. This means that a fiat-backed stablecoin is only as good as the organization that issues it. These organizations may be targeted by authorities who wish to maintain full control over a currency, and/or be subject to banking regulations which other stablecoins may not be.

**Examples**

_USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, GUSD_

#### Crypto-Backed Stablecoins

Crypto-backed stablecoins are exactly what they sound like; stablecoins backed by other cryptocurrencies. Crypto-backed stablecoins typically require users to deposit crypto assets of greater value, and require users to be over-collateralized in order to maintain a $1 peg.

**Advantages**

Crypto-backed stablecoins offer levels of decentralization that fiat-backed stablecoins cannot.

**Disadvantages**

Crypto-backed stablecoins are only as good as the underlying collateral that backs them and the protocol that issues them. If a protocol is unable to ensure that crypto-backed stablecoins are properly over-collateralized at all times, the crypto-backed stablecoins issued by the protocol may lose their peg. High levels of over-collateralization are typically needed in order for crypto-backed stablecoins to be issued in order to protect the peg during times of extreme market volatility.

**Examples**

_DAI, MIM_

#### Commodity-Backed Stablecoins

Commodity-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, except they are pegged to a commodity rather than a fiat currency, and thus issuers maintain reserves of commodities. Since commodities fluctuate in value, commodity-backed stablecoins also fluctuate.

**Advantages**

Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to gain exposure to key commodities while offering the same fungibility as other cryptos. Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to transact with commodities in ways that are not possible through legacy markets.

**Disadvantages**

Just like with fiat-backed stablecoins, centralized entities are typically needed to issue commodity-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves in order to ensure that one stablecoin can be redeemed for one unit of the commodity.

**Examples**

_PAXG, XAUT_

#### Algorithmic Stablecoins

Algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed by other crypto-assets. They use algorithms to maintain their peg, which often involve the minting and burning of tokens based on the demand and value of the circulating stablecoin driven by economic incentives determined by their on-chain algorithms.

**Advantages**

Algorithmic stablecoins are decentralized and may not require significant levels of over-collateralization to be issued.

**Disadvantages**

Since algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed, they are more susceptible to a de-peg than other types of stablecoins during market turmoil.

**Examples**

_FEI, UST, AMPL

### Utility Tokens

Utility tokens are tokens that are used to access a specific web3 product or service.&#x20;

In real life people typically buy general admission tickets that are exchanged for access to all sorts of organized events. In video games players often have the ability to earn or purchase in-game "currencies" that can be used to acquire in game items or experiences. In crypto people must earn or purchase utility tokens to transact on a specific network or use a unique application.

### Governance Tokens

Governance tokens represent control over of a network or application. Governance tokens allow networks and applications to widely distribute decision-making capabilities to their communities.&#x20;

Big tech companies are often critiqued for exploiting their users in an effort to earn more money for their investors. This is because users and investors are not well aligned since one directly profits off of the other.&#x20;

Governance tokens are typically distributed amongst users, contributors, and investors in order to better align the decision making process with the interests of all stakeholders.&#x20;
