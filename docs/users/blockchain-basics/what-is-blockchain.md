# What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a specific type of database that is coordinated and distributed across an open and public network of computer systems, with an ever-growing digital list of data points connected to one another acting as a decentralized public ledger.

The data that is added over time are structures called "blocks." Blocks build on top of each other in chronological order and include a piece of information that links each data block to the previous block, creating a verifiable chain all the way back to the genesis block (the first block). Blockchain is the core underlying component of [<mark style="color:blue;">crypto</mark>](what-is-crypto.md).&#x20;

Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies because its decentralized and trustless nature ensures that the truth of a state (facts, data, financial balances) is kept and maintained without relying on any centralized third party (centralized databases, financial institutions, or any authorities) and can be openly accessed by anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.

## What's Unique About a Blockchain?

### Decentralized

Blockchains run on **decentralized** networks, meaning that transactions on each block are recorded across many computers world wide to ensure that the data cannot be altered. If the data were to be altered it would retroactively alter all subsequent blocks through a cryptographic function called "_hashing_" which would be impossible to implement in the current world.

### Trustless

Blockchains utilize a **trustless** system, meaning that users do not need to know or trust each other or a third party for the source of truth in order for the system to function. In a trustless system, no single entity has authority over the system.

### Accessible

Blockchains allow anyone with an internet connection to **access** markets and applications without any identification barriers that some may face with centralized financial institutions. This makes it much easier for two parties to transact without the need for a trusted third party like a bank.

### Transparent

The **transparency** provided by blockchains benefits both regulators and companies; it simplifies and improves auditing processes for enterprises and provides permanent records of all transactions. Anybody can gain access to all transactional data from a blockchain.

### Self-Sovereign

Lastly, **self-sovereignty** is a distinct property in crypto. Crypto users maintain full ownership and control over things that belong to them, be it data, money, or access to services. In the traditional world, we are used to giving control to third party softwares to store and access our data, and we rely on third party intermediaries such as banks to facilitate transactions.&#x20;

In crypto, the underlying blockchain technology gives full sovereignty to the individuals and each individual is able to make the usual activities in a peer to peer or peer to protocol fashion facilitated by algorithms and smart contract code instead of a centralized intermediary, hence the popular meme “_be your own bank_.”

## Types of Blockchains

The most common blockchains utilize Proof of Stake or Proof of Work consensus mechanisms.

### What is a Consensus Mechanism?

A consensus mechanism is a procedure network participants follow in order to verify that the state of the data being transmitted on the network is correct. [<mark style="color:blue;">Blockchains</mark>](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics/what-is-a-blockchain) use consensus mechanisms to ensure that all network participants are in agreement on the data (transactions) being published on the decentralized public ledger. This is what enables [<mark style="color:blue;">crypto</mark>](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics/what-is-crypto) users to seamlessly transact without the need for a centralized authority.

#### Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains require network participants called "[_<mark style="color:blue;">validators</mark>_](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics/what-is-staking#validators)" to lock up crypto as collateral to ensure that they properly “_validate_” the data being included in a new entry on the distributed ledger. Validators are randomly selected to validate a block based on the amount of collateral they have locked up, or “[_<mark style="color:blue;">staked</mark>_](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics/what-is-staking),” hence the name “Proof of Stake.” Once a randomly selected validator validates a block, other validators verify its accuracy and the "_block rewards_," or newly minted units of crypto, are released.

> _**PoS blockchains limit the amount of validators that can take turns creating new blocks, making it faster and cheaper to reach a consensus.**_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Users of PoS blockchains like Umee**</mark>_](https://docs.umee.cc/user-guides/getting-started/creating-a-wallet) _**typically enjoy cheap, near-instant transactions.**_

> _**There is typically a limit to the amount of validators that can participate in a blockchain’s PoS consensus. Since validators are chosen randomly, they do not need to compete and use large amounts of energy to create new blocks, which is why newer PoS blockchains like Umee are viewed as an environmentally-friendly solution.**_

#### Proof of Work

> _**Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well known blockchains that use a Proof of Work consensus protocol.**_

Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains require network participants called “miners” to compete to solve a mathematical puzzle in order to create a new "_block_" or data entry to the decentralized public ledger. It takes a lot of work in order to solve the puzzle, hence the name “Proof of Work.” Once a new block has been created, other network participants must verify its accuracy in order to add it to the ledger, at which point the participant who proposed the block earns “block rewards,” or newly minted units of cryptocurrency issued to network participants in return for their role in securing the network.

> _**PoW blockchains allow an unlimited number of network participants to compete against one another to create new blocks, and the equipment and energy used can be costly. These costs are often imposed on users through expensive transaction fees and slower transactions.**_

> _**Since there is no limit to the amount of miners that can participate in PoW consensus, and the immense amount of computing power needed to create a new block on a PoW blockchain requires large amounts of energy, popular PoW blockchains like the Bitcoin network are often viewed as harmful to the environment.**_

## What Is Cross Chain Technology?

Most existing blockchains are isolated from each other, making it difficult for them to interact and communicate with one another. Cross chain technology was designed to fix this problem. Cross chain technology avoids reliance on a centralized entity, therefore avoiding third party risk such as abrupt withdrawal halts or operational shutdowns, and gives users full custody of their crypto with the goal of facilitating a faster processing time at a lower transaction cost. This will make it easier for anyone with an internet connection to transact across different blockchain networks from anywhere in the world.
